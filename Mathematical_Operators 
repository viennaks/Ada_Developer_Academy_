'''
At your bakery you charge $25 for a dozen cupcakes and $2.75 for a single cupcake. 

Write a function that uses mathematical operators to calculate the total cost for an order of cupcakes.

Your function will need to take 3 arguments: num_cupcakes_ordered, dozen_cupcakes_price and single_cupcake_price.

The function should print the total cost.

Don't forget to invoke your function to test it out.

def calculate_cupcake_totals(num_cupcakes_ordered, dozen_cupcakes_price, single_cupcake_price):
    dozen = 12

    # Use truncating division // to find how many dozens are in 17
    number_of_dozens = num_cupcakes_ordered // dozen
    # Use modulo % to find how many remaining cupcakes are in 17
    num_single_cupcakes = num_cupcakes_ordered % dozen

    # dont forget to use print statements to debug and see what your statements evaluate to

    # Use multiplication to calculate the cost for dozens of cupcakes and single cupcakes
    cost_for_doz = number_of_dozens * dozen_cupcakes_price
    cost_for_singles = single_cupcake_price * num_single_cupcakes

    total_cost = cost_for_doz + cost_for_singles

    # Print order total 
    print(f"The total cost for {num_cupcakes_ordered} is: ${total_cost}.")

calculate_cupcake_totals(17, 25, 2.75) # we pulled the quantity of cupcakes, the price per dozen and individual price outside of the function and added them as parameters
