'''
Use conditional branching to determine if a user provided username and password matches ones saved to the variables USR_NAME and USR_PSWRD.

If the username is invalid, print "Incorrect username". 
If the password in invalid, print "Incorrect password". 
If both are invalid, print "Both username and password invalid!"

If both username and password are valid, print the phrase "Welcome Back, AdaWada88!"

Try changing the values on lines 10 and 11 to different values to see if the correct values print out
